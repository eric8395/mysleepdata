A collection of my personal sleep data from 2019-2021. 

From Sleep Cycle, "*Sleep Cycle helps you to better health through better sleep. At its heart, it tracks your sleep cycles by listening to your sounds. It analyses those sounds by help of ever-evolving machine learning algorithms, and presents the results to you and helps you understand your sleep with unique data analysis and graphs. The habits that influence it and what you can do to improve your rest and recovery.*"
